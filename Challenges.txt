I've had my fair share of challenges over the years. Some of my biggest challenges have come from school, writing and acting. Math has always proven
difficult for me, especially Geometry, I never understood it and it took me forever to comprehend the subejct matter and formulas, but after long nights
of studying and meeting with the math teacher after school I was able to get a grasp on it and pass. Acting has always been a way for me to have fun and 
express myself, but I am scared of some roles or having to do certain things. I once had to play a serious role and for the longest time I felt as if 
I was doing it wrong but I would constantly run lines over my head and once the Director and I understood eachother I felt comfortable with the
preformance I gave.
